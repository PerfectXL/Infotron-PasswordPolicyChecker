Infotron PasswordPolicyChecker
==============================

Construct a regular expression that can be used to check the complexity of a password. The regular expression can be configured with different parameters, see `PasswordPolicyConfiguration`.

There is also an MVC Data Annotation Attribute that you can use to decorate the password field in your view model. This attribute uses a static configuration that you can configure on application startup. Look at `Global.asax.cs` in the MVC sample project to find out how this is done.
